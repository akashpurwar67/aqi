                This website provides real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data to
                help you stay informed about the air quality in your area. By
                checking the AQI, you can make informed decisions to protect
                your health, especially during times of poor air quality. Our
                platform also offers health recommendations based on AQI levels,
                your age, and existing health conditions. Stay safe and take
                proactive steps to maintain your well-being.
